# On the impact of sameAs on schema matching
This repository contains all Python scripts and data necessary to replicate our experiments of our paper "On the impact of sameAs on schema matching".

With these experiments we aim at answering three research questions:

1. Does the inclusion of instance-level interlinks improves instance-based schema alignments?
    
2. Does the inclusion of instance-level interlinks impact instance-based schema alignments differently when only the concepts' explicit members are considered? I.e. without considering the transitive subsumption relation. 
    
3. Is there a relation between the quality of the instance-level interlinks and the schema alignments' quality?
